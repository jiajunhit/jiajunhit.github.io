about the **application**

It is just a begining of the plan, I want to commit something everyday.

It have been almost a month that we write the application for Dr. WU.

We start at searching for papers and reading that.

I think I have learned something from that. We use Mendeley to read papers, it feels good.

To be honest, I did not read as much as others did. I wasted a lot of time.
